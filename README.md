We're going to sift through all those tweets and figure out the sentiment behind each one, like whether they're happy, sad, neutral or even irrelevant. We're doing this through something called sentiment analysis, and we're using a beast of a model called Roberta, created by the wizards over at Facebook.

You don't need a supercomputer to do this - we're going to run everything in Google Colab. It's an online coding playground that even gives us free GPU power! First, we need to get our coding environment all set up. We'll be using some handy tools - the Transformers library to give us the Roberta model, and Accelerate to shift our calculations over to the GPU.

We're using a ready-made dataset for this tutorial. It's from Kaggle, a great place to get datasets, and it's all about Twitter sentiment analysis. We upload the dataset to Google Colab, do a bit of cleanup, and then split it into a bigger chunk for training and a smaller one for testing.

Next, we have to tokenize our data. This is a fancy way of saying we're breaking down our text into chunks or "tokens" that our model can understand.

Now that we've got our tokens, we need to convert our data into a format that PyTorch, our chosen deep learning library, can understand. This is like translating it into PyTorch's native language. We create a custom PyTorch Dataset for this.

Next up, we get our Roberta model ready to roll. Roberta is a transformer-based model, which means it's a pretty big deal and powerful. But thanks to the Transformers library, setting it up is a breeze.

Before we jump into training, we've got to set up some ground rules - these are our training arguments. It's like telling our model how hard to work, where to save its progress, and how often to check its performance.

Once we've got all that sorted, it's time for our model to hit the gym! We create a Trainer, feed it our model, training arguments and datasets, and let it do its thing.

Training can take a while, so you might want to grab a coffee. Remember, we're training a big model on a load of data, so it's going to take some time. After it's done flexing its muscles, we can check how well our model's done on the test set.
